  ## Usage
  Run "npm start" from the command line. (If you would like to work with the included test data, first run "npm run seed" from the command line).

This project does not include a front end, so you will need to interact with the routes using Insomnia Core or a similar API client. 

The available routes are:
- Get all Categories
- Get a single Category by ID
- Create (POST), Edit (PUT), or Delete a Category
- Get all Products
- Get a single Product by ID
- Create (POST), Edit (PUT), or Delete a Product
- Get all Tags
- Get a single Tag by ID
- Create (POST), Edit (PUT), or Delete a Tag

Visit the routes in your API client. For POST or PUT routes you will need to supply the JSON to create or edit an item.
