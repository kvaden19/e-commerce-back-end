# e-commerce-back-end

## TODOs:

### Routes:
- WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
- WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database

### Testing

### Deliverables:
- README
- Walkthru video

#### Questions:
Why are product_tag and ProductTag both created?
product_tag is the one that gets seeded
Did I need to make a Model ProductTag?
